# Pig-Game
This is an application of the classic Pig Game.

Rules:
In the bottom of the application you can enter a score you would like to play to. (30 is the default to win the game if nothing is selected)

Two dice are rolled when you click and that score will get added to your total score. You can hold after your roll or keep riding the high. 

However if you roll two of the same number your turn is over and the score you accumulated that round will be lost.

*This is why holding is beneficial to ensure that you can keep some of your points to start and slowly build your way to the score that will win the game.
